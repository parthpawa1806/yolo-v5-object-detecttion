# YOLOv5 Object Detection using Google Colab

üîç This project demonstrates how to use YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm, in Google Colab. YOLOv5 is an upgraded version of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) family of models, known for its real-time object detection capabilities. Google Colab provides a free cloud-based environment with GPU support, making it an excellent choice for running deep learning models.

üñºÔ∏è **Note**: To run this project, you need a GPU runtime environment in Google Colab. Ensure that you have selected a GPU runtime before running the code.

## Getting Started

 Clone the YOLOv5 repository:
   ```bash
   !git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5.git
